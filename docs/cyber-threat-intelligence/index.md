## Structure

This section is divided into four main areas:

1. **Fundamentals**: Learn about the intelligence cycle, threat actors, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and how to turn raw data into actionable intelligence.  
[Go to Fundamentals →](fundamentals/index.md)

2. **OSINT**: Explore techniques and tools for collecting information from publicly available sources, while respecting legal and ethical boundaries.  
[Go to OSINT →](osint/index.md)

3. **SOCMINT**: Discover how to analyze social media data and metadata to gain insights about targets, campaigns, or emerging threats.  
[Go to SOCMINT →](socmint/index.md)

4. **Dark Web**: Understand the types of dark web sites, the risks involved, and the tools used for safe exploration and intelligence gathering.  
[Go to Dark Web →](dark-web/index.md)
