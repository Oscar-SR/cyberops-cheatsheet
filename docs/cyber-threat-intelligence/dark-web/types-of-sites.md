# Types of sites

The Dark Web hosts a variety of services, ranging from legitimate privacy-focused spaces to illicit environments. Understanding how they are organized and what signals to watch for helps plan monitoring safely and without engaging in prohibited activities.

## Directories

- **Indexes:** List services and allow keyword queries. They are often incomplete and sometimes outdated.

- **Risk of clones:** Popular sites often have fake domains that imitate their appearance to steal funds or credentials. Always verify the PGP key or the operator’s official announcement when available.

## Forums and communities

- **Topics:** Security and anonymity, leaks, fraud, peer-to-peer trading, technical manuals, and general discussions under pseudonyms.

- **Structure:** Registration by invitation or captchas, reputation-based hierarchies, moderated threads.

- **Signals to watch:** Forum creation date, actual activity (users per 24h), posting rules, history of closures or migrations.

- **Note:** Passive access for analysis is subject to forum rules; do not participate or request/share illegal material.

## Marketplaces

- **Model:** Catalogs with sellers, ratings, shopping carts, and cryptocurrency payments. Many use escrow (custody) and internal messaging with PGP. Escrow is an intermediary mechanism in which a neutral third party holds a payment or asset until the conditions agreed upon by the parties are fulfilled.

- **Common categories:** Stolen data, forged documents, intrusion tools, substances, cards/credentials, cash-out or drop services.

- **Volatility:** Closures due to operator exit scams, police seizures, and frequent migrations to new .onion domains.

- **Risks:** Phishing, exit scams, and malware in downloads. Any interaction may be illegal; professional analysis is limited to observation, evidence preservation, and reporting.

## Leak sites and secure dropboxes

- **Ransomware group leak sites:** Pages where data samples are published to pressure victims. They usually list the organization, date, and "proof identifiers". Lockbit pages are an example of a Dark Web site where data stolen by the Lockbit ransomware can be obtained.

- **Secure dropboxes for legitimate leaks:** Projects like SecureDrop and GlobaLeaks provide anonymous channels for journalists and NGOs; these are legitimate uses focused on protecting sources.

- **Consideration:** Never download or redistribute personal data; work with partial screenshots and report through established institutional channels.

## Communication and utility services

- **.onion email and messaging:** Privacy-focused email and instant messaging providers, using PGP/OTR.

- **Pastebins and wikis:** Sharing of text, manuals, how-tos, and listings; useful for tracking narratives and operator announcements.

- **Mirrors and status pages:** Sites that publish official mirrors and service statuses to mitigate takedowns.

## Observable Technical Infrastructure

- **Panels and dashboards:** Occasionally, administrative interfaces are accidentally exposed (brief time windows).

- **C2 and beacons:** Some investigations document traces of command-and-control infrastructure; identifying them requires extreme caution and coordination with specialized teams.

- **Best practices:** Do not interact; limit activities to observation and reporting to the appropriate security channels.
