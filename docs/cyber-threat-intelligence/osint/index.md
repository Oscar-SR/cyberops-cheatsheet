# OSINT

Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the discipline that **identifies, collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates** information from publicly accessible sources—such as websites, social media, news media, government databases, Internet technical data, satellite imagery, and others—in order to respond to a specific **intelligence requirement** [[1]](../references.md#1).

## Intelligence requirement

Therefore, an intelligence requirement is the defining element that triggers the cyber intelligence process [[2]](../references.md#2). Examples of how to transform a problem into a intelligence requirement could be the following ones [[1]](../references.md#1):

| Problem | Intelligence Requirement |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| Suspecting that an organization or individual is carrying out malicious activities | Determine if this person is associated with a terrorist group |
| A company needs information about the risks of operating in a specific country or region | Assess the political and economic stability of a country to consider an investment |
| Tracking or solving a crime | Locate the whereabouts of a fugitive |
| Keeping track of a competitor or a target organization | Monitor the activities of a competing company |
| Ensuring the accuracy of media reports or political claims | Verify the authenticity of a news story or statement |

## Historical evolution

- **1941–1980 (Pre-digital era):**  
  The U.S. Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBIS) monitored foreign radio broadcasts during World War II; this practice institutionalized the use of open sources to support strategic decision-making.

- **1990s–2000s:**  
  The expansion of the Internet multiplied open data repositories, and the first open data portals appeared. OSINT was still considered a complement to SIGINT/HUMINT.

- **2010–2020:**  
  The explosion of social media, mobile broadband, and open government data elevated OSINT as a key discipline in investigative journalism (e.g., Arab Spring or Panama Papers leaks).

- **2022–present:**  
  The war in Ukraine and the popularization of generative AI have made OSINT a primary source of real-time situational awareness, capable of verifying military movements via satellite images and geolocated videos shared by the community.

## Current situation

Nowadays, the scope and relevance of OSINT have been amplified, mainly due to these three factors:

1. **Data proliferation:** Every minute, millions of posts, records, and transactions are uploaded; even commercial satellites offer revisit times of less than 24 hours over most of the planet.

2. **AI and automation tools:** Computer vision algorithms, natural language processing, and link analysis allow filtering noise and detecting hidden patterns.

3. **Regulatory maturity:** Frameworks such as GDPR or the EU AI Act require the integration of privacy and transparency, professionalizing the discipline.

## Use cases

- **Conflict verification:** Analysis of satellite images and videos to confirm movements and damages almost in real time.

- **Disinformation detection:** Monitoring hashtags and coordinated bot networks. Increasingly challenging with generative AI (deepfakes).

- **Supply chain risks:** Cross-referencing customs, patents, and corporate records to detect business links and potential sanctions violations.

- **Cybercrime investigation:** Correlation of domains, TLS certificates, and forums for technical and contextual attribution of malware, phishing, or ransomware campaigns.
