# Introduction

A practical and continuously evolving reference for **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**, focused on **OSINT, malware analysis, indicators of compromise (IOCs), threat actors, and adversary behavior**.

This cheatsheet is designed to be **quick to consult**, **easy to navigate**, and **useful in real-world analysis**, incident response, and research scenarios.

## 🔄 Intelligence Mindset

This cheatsheet follows the **Cyber Intelligence lifecycle**:

1. **Collection** – Gathering data from multiple sources
2. **Processing** – Normalizing and structuring information
3. **Analysis** – Extracting insights and identifying patterns
4. **Dissemination** – Sharing actionable intelligence
5. **Feedback** – Improving based on outcomes
