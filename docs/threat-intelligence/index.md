# Threat intelligence

A **cyberthreat** is understood as the possibility of carrying out malicious actions that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the resources of a computer system. Therefore, **threat intelligence** refers to the knowledge, skills, and experience-based information about cyberthreats, aimed at helping to mitigate potential attacks and harmful events that occur in cyberspace.

In the field of cybersecurity, threat intelligence plays a crucial role in understanding digital threats and anticipating potential attacks. Threat intelligence provides context, such as who is attacking us, what their motivation and capabilities are, and which indicators of compromise allow us to detect the attacks. This context helps organizations make faster, more informed security decisions and shift their approach from reactive to proactive in combating attacks.
